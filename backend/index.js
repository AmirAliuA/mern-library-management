/*
  This backend application is built using Node.js with the Express framework and connects to a
  MongoDB database. It serves as an API for managing a library's book inventory, allowing users
  to perform various operations such as adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting books.

  Key features:
    - CRUD Operations:
        The backend supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for book records, 
        allowing users to manage their library inventory effectively.
    
    - Category Filtering:
        Users can retrieve books by category, enabling easier access to specific types of literature.
    
    - RESTful API: 
        The application follows RESTful principles, making it intuitive to interact with using standard HTTP methods.

  How It Works:
    - Setup and Initialization:
        The application initializes by loading environment variables from a .env file, which includes the MongoDB connection string.
        It creates an instance of an Express application and sets up middleware for handling CORS and JSON request bodies.

    - MongoDB Connection:
        A MongoDB client is created, and the application connects to the MongoDB server. It verifies the connection by sending a ping command.

    - Route Definitions:
        Various API endpoints are defined using Express route handlers:
        POST /upload-book: Inserts a new book record into the database.
        GET /all-books: Retrieves all book records or filters them by category.
        PATCH /book/:id: Updates an existing book record identified by its ID.
        DELETE /book/:id: Deletes a book record identified by its ID.
        GET /book/:id: Retrieves a single book record based on its ID.

    - Error Handling:
        The application includes error handling for database operations, ensuring that users receive appropriate error messages if something goes wrong.

    - Server Listening:
        Finally, the application starts listening on a specified port (default is 5000), making it ready to handle incoming API requests.

  Why I placed the route handlers outside the run asynchronus function:
    - Server setup seperation: 
        Maintain a clear separation between the applicationâ€™s setup logic (like connecting to the database) 
        and the route handlers. This organization makes the code easier to read and maintain.

    - Application initialization:
        express app (+ routes) is ready to handle requests 
        as soon as the server starts listening, even if the database connection is still established.

    - Consistent structure & code readibility

    - Scope management
